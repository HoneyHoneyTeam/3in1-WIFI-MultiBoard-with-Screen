## What is it, and what can the Multiboard do??

The 3-in-1 Multiboard contains three chipsets: ESP32, nRF24, and CC1101. 

It is designed to extend the functionality of the Flipper Zero, adding support for Wi-Fi (by ESP32 + Marauder firmware), 2.4GHz RF (by nRF24), and expanded SubGHz coverage (by CC1101).

<br/>

## Specification of the Multiboard

- ESP32-S2 Chipset for Wifi & Pre-load with Marauder 
- CC1101 SubGhz chipset (433mhz)
- NRF24 2.4Ghz Chipset 
- 1.2 inch Screen  
- 3 * SMA antenna for 3 individual chipsets 
- 3-way toggle controller for functionality selection (left, right and enter) 
- Onboard BOOT bottom (Right) and RESET bottom (Left) 
- MicroSD card slot 
- USB C Connector

<br/>

  
## How the Multiboard operate 

- Simply plug the Multiboard into the Flipper Zero, use the toggler to select one of the three chipsets and confirm the selection, then choose one of the relative apps on the Flipper, and you're good to go.
- The nRF24 and CC1101 chipsets do not require additional firmware to function. Most Flipper Zero firmware, including Momentum, Unleashed, and others, support them natively.
- The ESP32 requires Marauder firmware to function, and it comes pre-loaded with the firmware on the ESP32 chipset.

## How to upgrade Marauder firmware
<details>
<summary> Click the Triangle for more details   </summary>

<br/>

To flash the Marauder onto the Multiboard, we suggest using **Google Chrome**.  

There are two buttons located near the screen: the button on the right is the Boot button, and the one on the left is the Reset button. 

1. Open the Web Flasher called < FzeeFlasher > [https://fzeeflasher.com/](https://fzeeflasher.com). 

2. Connect the USB-C cable to the board. Then, while **holding the BOOT button** (on the right side of the board), plug the USB-C cable into your laptop / PC / Mac. In this way, the board launch into Bootloader mode rather than starting up normally

3. Then, On https://fzeeflasher.com/, go to [ **Connect** ]. In the pop-up window, select [ **USB Serial (ComXxX) - Paired** ], which usually has only one serial for most users. Then, click [ **Connect** ].

4. If everything is working correctly, the website should allow you to select the model of the board. Choose [ **ESP32-S2** ]. Then, select your preferred [ **Version** ] of Marauder and choose [ **Marauder** ] under [ **Firmware** ].

5. Then the website should allow you to hit [ **PROGRAM** ] bottom.
    
6. In a minute then you are golden. 

FYI. 

- Some people might need a few attempts to get it working during the process of getting the board into Bootloader mode, aka holding the BOOT button and connecting the USB-C cable, and the web refresher recogize it. Just be patient and try a few times.
- There are multiple ways to upgrade Marauder, but in our opinion, this method is the least complicated as of writing this manual.

## Warrenty and Tech Support

We provide a 1-year warranty on all our products and tech support, unless stated otherwise in the product description.

FYI, our [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/HoneyHoneyTrading) shop is no longer in operation. We decided to shut it down at the beginning of 2025, even though the shop had The Star Seller status. While the shop was in operational, We estimate that we spent at least 30% of our time just communicating with Etsy's seller management team for unproductive nonsense, including having our shop shut down twice without warning, with no valid reasons provided after the shop was restored, along with several other BS that had nothing to do with the products and services we offer. 

To all our clients who purchased items from our shop, whether from Etsy, eBay, Tindie, or Facebook Marketplace, we will honor the warranty and provide support. Please feel free to email us at Support@honeyhoneylab.com. or [Whatsapp](https://wa.me/61452559581)
